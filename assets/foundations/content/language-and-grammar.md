## Simplicity and clarity

When explaining things, be as clear and precise as you can. And use simple terms consistently. Consistent use of definitive words improves user comprehension and also helps out with accessibility and translation. Make sure sentences are short and drive value.

If you have any doubt about user comprehension, you can either ask the UX Research team for input, ask other designers or simply look up how users are talking on Twitter.

  
| Column 1 | Column 2 |  
| --- | --- |  
| *âœ… DO*<br>Tu n'as pas de connexion internet | *ðŸš« DON'T*<br>Un problÃ¨me est survenu lors de la connexion |  


## Active voice

We use active voice most of the time because itâ€™s clearer, more direct, and easier to read than passive voice. Itâ€™s also more conversational.

There are rare cases where you may use passive voice, when things aren't going according to plan (e.g. when a bet has been lost), avoid telling users that anything that isn't working is their fault.

  
| Column 1 | Column 2 |  
| --- | --- |  
| *âœ… DO*<br>Tu as ajoutÃ© un pari<br>Le pari est perdu | *ðŸš« DON'T*<br>Un pari vient d'Ãªtre ajoutÃ©<br>Tu as perdu le pari |  


## Ways of addressing

At Betclic, we see ourselves as our users' partner, as their friend almost. We usually have a casual way of talking and are pretty straightforward, sometimes cheeky even.

### About Betclic: 'Nous'

We always use the 'Nous' noun when we are mentioning our app, our company, our teams. Itâ€™s one way that we make experiences feel more personal. We want users to know that there are people behind Betclic products and that weâ€™re in this with them. The use of 'Nous' instead of 'On' balances out the casualness of our tone.

  
| Column 1 | Column 2 |  
| --- | --- |  
| *âœ… DO*<br>Nous sommes dÃ©solÃ©s<br>Peux-tu nous communiquer ton justificatif de domicile ? | *ðŸš« DON'T*<br>On est dÃ©solÃ© pour le dÃ©sagrÃ©ment<br>L'appli Betclic est actuellement hors service |  


### To user: 'Tu'

When addressing our users, we almost always use 'Tu' as the standard noun for a hint of familiarity and proximity.

  
| Column 1 | Column 2 |  
| --- | --- |  
| *âœ… DO*<br>OÃ¹ es-tu nÃ© ?<br>Tu as gagnÃ© le pari | *ðŸš« DON'T*<br>Choisissez votre pseudo<br>Vous devez faire un dÃ©pÃ´t pour commencer Ã  jouer |  


## To user: 'Vous'

However, there are cases where we employ 'Vous' when addressing the users. These situations are limited to the following contexts:

- Any serious situation that need careful care and attention.

- Privacy concerns and problems

- Security concerns and problems

- Fraud concerns

- Legal concerns

- At-risk behaviors

## As user: 'Je'

Sometimes components represent the user's side of the conversation, so itâ€™s OK to use first person there to represent the customerâ€™s voice and maintain the conversational quality of the experience. We do not do this with buttons however, we do our best to keep buttons without any nouns and strictly stick to actions/verbs.

  
| Column 1 | Column 2 |  
| --- | --- |  
| *âœ… DO*<br>Je certifie avoir 18 ans<br>J'accepte de recevoir des mails de la part de Betclic | *ðŸš« DON'T*<br>CTA: Je souhaite faire un dÃ©pÃ´t |  


## Use of jargon

### Technical jargon

Never use it.

### Sports jargon

Slang, colloquial terms and metaphors that are commonly used in sports and sports betting can be used, but should be used very sparingly to ensure that the content is accessible to a broad audience and preserve message clarity. If users might be engaged/entertained by a metaphor, supplement it with a more literal interpretation.

  
| Column 1 | Column 2 |  
| --- | --- |  
| *âœ… DO*<br>Tu entres sur le terrain !<br>Tu peux commencer Ã  parier. CrÃ©e ton premier pari. | *ðŸš« DON'T*<br>Tu entres sur le terrain !<br>(With no additional information) |  


### "Verlant"

We avoid switching syllables in words (a common way of speaking for young French people). By trying to be cool, we end up seeming old.

## Simple tenses

Here are the only acceptable verb tenses that we use on the UI:

- Past: passÃ© composÃ©

- Present: prÃ©sent simple

- Future: futur simple

- Order: impÃ©ratif

- Causal tense: conditionnel (sparingly)

- Call to actions: l'infinitif

  
| Column 1 | Column 2 |  
| --- | --- |  
| *âœ… DO*<br>PassÃ© composÃ© : Ton pari a Ã©tÃ© annulÃ©<br>PrÃ©sent simple : La photo est-elle nette ?<br>Futur simple : Ton justificatif sera validÃ© en moins de 5 minutes<br>ImpÃ©ratif : Choisis ton pseudo<br>Infinitif: CTA : "Accepter", "Se connecter", "Fermer", "Continuer" | *ðŸš« DON'T*<br>PassÃ© simple : Ton pari fut annulÃ©<br>Forme de question incorrecte au prÃ©sent simple : Elle est nette la photo ?<br>Futur antÃ©rieur : Tu pourras jouer quand tu auras fait un dÃ©pÃ´t<br>PremiÃ¨re personne au singulier : CTA : "Je veux X", "M'inscrire", "J'ai compris" |  


## Global thinking, local working

As an international company, we operate in multiple markets in EU (France, Portugal, Poland, Italy) and Africa. We need to be mindful about how different messages can be interpreted in different locations. Always make sure you are clear, concise, inclusive, culturally-sensitive and that the translation or localization efforts are well thought of.
