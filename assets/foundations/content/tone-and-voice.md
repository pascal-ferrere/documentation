In order to make our platform more human, we must give our product a unified voice that conversates with our users in multiple contexts. Different situations on the platform generate different user emotions, so we adapt our voice to better identify with the user. This when voice becomes tone variations. These variations allow us to respond humanly, empathetically and connect with user feeling different emotions.

> In short: voice is who we are. Tone is how we say it.

## Voice

The best way to describe Betclic's voice is to imagine Betclic as your *"older brother"*. Why?

An older brother is a person who you're close to, the conversations between you two are light and casual. He's respectful of your wishes, challenges and needs, and will always be factual and concise when things get serious. It's also someone who's very empathetic and will always do work to protect you and keep your best interests at heart.

We use our main voice when:

- Everything’s going well and there’s nothing to note, alert on, or celebrate. It's a pretty neutral voice when there's no end goal nor risk.

- Our users feel confident and at ease.

## Tones

There are times, however, when we need to adjust how we say things to fit the situation at hand.

### Best friend

> When a user signs up it's because they're ready to start playing.

 With that comes multiple emotions they might be feeling:

- Excitement

- Hope

- Uncertainty

To cater to the user's needs and meet their expectations, we rely on a tone variation that we call the *"best friend"*. Why?

When user is signing up, we want to address them in a light and friendly way, we want to be respectful, but also make them aware of different aspects and features. This is the moment to describe the experience they're about to embark upon, and always be very empathetic and thank them for their trust.

### Favorite teacher

> When user is being onboarded and learning how it works.

When a user confirms their sign up, they start to learn how things work, it's our duty to address them correctly for a successful onboarding, we anticipate multiple emotions they might be feeling:

- Uncertainty

- Ignorance

- Openness

- Excitement

- Impatience

In this situation, we rely on a specific tone variation that we call the *"favorite teacher"*. Why?

Your favorite teacher has a way of explaining things that makes you learn more, faster and easier. Your favorite teacher is halfway between light and serious, they're a little more casual than they are formal, always respectful and factual, they stay concise to optimize education.

### Lawyer buddy

> For every situation that entails responsible gaming, consent, data and privacy matters.

In situations where a user is dealing with one of the following serious topics:

- Responsible gaming (assistance, awareness, termination)

- Data privacy and consent

- Account security

- Payments

- And any other important and/or sensitive information

They feel may feel a different range of emotions:

- Doubt

- Inspection

- Cautiousness

We need to address these matters in a clear, concise and transparent way. The best tone variation is called the *"lawyer buddy"*. Why?

Your lawyer is the person who knows details better than you do. Their primary job is to advise you, guide you and help you make the best decision for yourself. A lawyer's job is to make sure you are protected and being heard. We need to be serious, rather formal, respectful AND alarming, very factual and concise, all while conveying the message in a human way.

### Supportive friend

> When user loses a bet.

*Level 1 loss*

Losing a bet is never fun for anyone, it's even harder on our user as they're dealing with losing a bet, losing money and potentially having their favorite team lose at their favorite sports.

Our user may feel a range of emotions such as:

- Frustration

- Disappointment

- Sadness

- Anger

A level 1 loss means losing a bet with little risk, meaning that the money lost isn't a large amount, and wouldn't be financially stressful to the user. This level of loss may allow the emotions felt to be short-lived, and let user have some perspective on the whole situation.

In this situation, our adopted tone variation that meets the user's expectations is *"Supportive friend"*. Why?

We want to connect with the user by being respectful, empathetic and concise about what just happened. We adopt a more serious tone all while remaining casual.

*Level 2 loss*

When a user loses a bet that represents a large amount of money, they're also dealing with the loss of their favorite team at their favorite sports. This represents a much more negative and uncomfortable situation for the user than level 1 loss.

Our user may feel a range of strong emotions such as:

- Distress

- Regret

- Self-doubt

- Anxiety

- Anger

In this situation, our adopted tone variation that meets the user's expectations is a different version of *"Supportive friend"*. Why?

We still want to connect with the user by being empathetic, concise and factual about what just happened. However, we decide to become more serious because we believe any big loss is a serious situation, and we also become more alarming since larger bets are riskier.

### Proud coach

> When user wins a bet.

*Level 1 win*

Winning a bet is something every user wants, this is a moment to celebrate since the user has won a bet, made money and probably witnessed their favorite team win the game.

The pleasurable emotions that are linked to winning a bet are:

- Excitement

- Pleasure

- Pride

- Contentment

In this situation, we rely on a specific tone variation that we call the *"proud coach"*. Why?

Every one knows a coach who's motivational, a coach who's guidance, help and empathy has helped them win at what they did. A player's win is always a coach's win, so they're always proud, no matter what. When a user wins a bet, we want to be very light to celebrate them, be casual yet respectful. Very empathetic and quite enthusiastic!

*Level 2 win*

When a user wins a bet and a large amount of money, they expect us to celebrate with them and let them know that they did a great job, all while celebrating their team's win. This represents a much more positive and celebratory situation for the user than level 1 win.

Our user may feel a range of strong emotions such as:

- Happiness

- Luck

- Satisfaction

- Confidence

- Euphoria

- Pride

In this situation, our adopted tone variation that meets the user's expectations is a different version of the *"proud coach"*. Why?

When a user wins a bet, we want to be very light to celebrate them, be casual yet respectful. However, we decide to become more enthusiastic and more empathetic. This is a huge win!

### Cheerleader

> When user is awaiting for the outcome of a bet or an event.

*Level 1 wait*

Timing is everything when it comes to sports and gaming. Scores can change in seconds, balances shift in minutes and nothing is impossible up until the last moment. A user who's placed a bet and who's waiting for an outcome feels the same emotions as a supporter awaiting the final score:

- Uncertainty

- Anticipation

- Wait

In this situation, our adopted tone variation is the *"cheerleader"*. Why?

It's our duty to connect with our user when they're feeling like time isn't passing by. We need to understand what they're going through and make sure we keep things light and enthusiastic, after all, no one knows the outcome of the bet so we should remain optimistic (and realistic!)

> Some extra info:

*Level 2 wait*

In what we consider level 2 wait, the user has waited long enough or the outcome might be very soon. In this situation, the user goes through different emotions that are stronger than the ones in level 1 wait:

- Nervousness

- Boredom

- Anxiety

In this situation, our adopted tone variation that meets the user's expectations is a different version of the *"cheerleader"*. Why?

With stronger emotions, we adapt our tone to match user's expectations. Our tone becomes more empathetic and more respectful.
