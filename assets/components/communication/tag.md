# Tag

Tags are non-interactive elements used for visual labeling on the UI. 

---

Simply put, tags are colored badges that contain textual information relevant to the userâ€™s understanding of a pageâ€™s content or betting information. For example, they could be used to display a gameâ€™s results or the number of bets placed on a game.

## Usage

Tags are non-interactive elements used for labeling and for signaling custom pieces of betting info to the user. The important thing to remember is that tags are used in a personalized, customized way, such as displaying the number of bets a user has in a game.

This component is used for:

- Labelling

- Displaying the amount of placed bets

- Game status

- Bet results (Won / Lost / Cancelled)

## Variants

In addition to all the different styles listed above, tags are available in the following variants:

- Default (DEF)

- Alternative (ALT)

*Note:* Live tags use the ALT variant. This is the best option for dark backgrounds and live events.

## Anatomy

Tags are simple elements comprised of a non-interactive colored container, an optional icon, and a text label. Their color indicates their usage.

Legend, 1. Container â€”Â available in various colors that are used to display different styles.
2. Optional icon â€”Â icons are placed 8 px to the left side of the text label.
3. Text label â€” for written or numeric information such as game results or amount of bets placed.  
  


## Placement

Tags should be carefully placed on the UI. Their placement needs to indicate to the user that they are not interactive â€” this is why itâ€™s not a good idea to place tags near interactive elements, such as buttons.

Tags should be placed on content in a specific way so that they convey useful information to the user and donâ€™t interfere with any other interactive elements.

## Behavior

Tags have no clickable behavior because they are not interactive.

Their style and content will change according to game updates or system changes.

## Dos & Donâ€™ts

  
![âœ… DO](https://studio-assets.supernova.io/design-systems/27883/4c5cef87-16bb-4417-aec1-1a4f0cb4187a.png)  
âœ… DO, Use tags to display customized, personalized snippets of textual info that need to stand out from the standard UI. This textual information could include gaming or betting information.  
  
![ðŸš« DON'T](https://studio-assets.supernova.io/design-systems/27883/48aeb7f6-2d52-4513-a9d6-9de0195ccf27.png)  
ðŸš« DON'T, Avoid using tags for marketing messages or general system info â€” this is not their purpose. Tags are used for customized info generally related to the betting or game experience.  
  
![âœ… DO](https://studio-assets.supernova.io/design-systems/27883/d9626770-f6d5-48b5-95b2-0703fe1c341f.png)  
âœ… DO, Use tags sparingly and be considerate with their placement. A typical UI should only contain tags if they are needed.  
  
![ðŸš« DON'T](https://studio-assets.supernova.io/design-systems/27883/1599e7d4-efe2-4609-8445-5dc5860725b0.png)  
ðŸš« DON'T, Avoid placing tags near interactive elements â€” user confusion can occur if a tagâ€™s purpose is not understood.  
  


## Microcopy

### General

For written tag text labels must be as concise as possible. Their terminology and nomenclature must remain consistent throughout the product. Using different terminology for similar tags could lead to user frustration. Treat tags in the same way you treat navigation terminology â€”Â keep it simple and consistent. Consider adding an icon as a visual aid or to help create patterns.

### Wordcount

You should aim to only use one word per tag. There may be occasions where two words are used, however, the preferred amount is to use only one word per tag. Always opt for one word only. For further brevity and clarity, never allow tag text to wrap or truncate.

### Casing

To save space, tags should be written in either title case or sentence case depending on the terms used. Try to avoid uppercase unless there is a specific reason to do so, e.g. acronyms.

### Punctuation

Tags do not require any punctuation. Terminal punctuation of any kind is not used.

### Localization

Translate your tag text label to see if it adequately fits into the container layout. English has one of the shortest character counts and often increases in length when translated into the main languages that Betclic products use â€” which is French, Polish, and Portuguese.
