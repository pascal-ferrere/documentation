# Link

On web, for desktop and mobile, this component provides an interactive text link for the user to click if needed.

---

Its purpose is to navigate the user to a different screen within the website or to an external page.

Links are easy to spot on the UI because they look different to other text elements. They are mainly used within body text, but can also be used by itself if relevant e.g. in a card or below a text box.

Links are not used within native apps, however, they do appear on websites for both desktop and mobile.

## Usage

Interactive links should always be used purposefully, meaning that their inclusion on the UI should be beneficial to the user flow.

We do not use links randomly, so their usage must have some reason or related context behind it. The user must know why the link is there and why they may need to interact with it (this would normally be explained in the accompanying body text).

In general, it would be very unlikely to find a link without any other supporting text. Typical uses include, “Read more”, “T&Cs”, “Updates to products”, external betting or game info, support services, contact pages, etc.

*Links are used for:*

Allowing the user to view supporting or contextual information

Providing the user with navigation to external web pages

Providing the user with navigation to other areas of the app that are displayed on a new screen

## States

Links are formed from normal text. Once pressed, an underline appears on the text to show that it was clicked.

*Links exist in two states:*

- Default

- Pressed

## Variants

Links are offered in different text sizes to match the corresponding text styles used in Betclic products. This includes:

## Anatomy

Links are formed from regular text styles that are used throughout Betclic products. They are displayed in bold weights and opposing colors to the body text.

There is no other anatomical information because the interactive aspects of the link are hidden inside the text itself.

## Placement

Links are either used inside regular body text or they can be positioned close to supporting body text (to help add context to the link).

The presence of a link should always be obvious to the user. Links should not be hidden under other elements.

## Behavior

The behavior of a link is quite simple, they either navigate the user to another part of the app, or they are used to open a web page inside a browser external to the app.

After an interaction, links change state and display an underline to show the user that they have been clicked previously.

## Dos & Don’ts

*Do: *Use links with contextual purpose and think carefully about what value the presence of a link brings — a link should always be relevant to the content on the screen.

*Don’t:* Never use links without context or as links to random locations or websites that have no relevance to what is currently on screen. Every time a user clicks a link, it is interrupting the betting or gaming experience, therefore its inclusion must be for a specific reason.

## Microcopy

### General

Links should be written in the same way that regular body text is created. The only difference is that links are used in bold and in a different color to the regular body text.

Try to keep the text as concise as possible, especially if it is a link to an external website. There is no need to include URL info because this is already included in the rich text information.

Also, avoid overly describing the link, e.g. “Please click this link to learn loads more information about blah blah...”

A simple “Read more” is much more effective.

### Casing

Please use the same casing approach that the regular body text uses, which is generally a mixed style of title and sentence casing. Uppercase can be used for acronyms, e.g. “T&Cs” but it should not be used without a specific reason.

### Localization

Because links are created in the same way that regular text is, translated link text should be handled by the translation team.

One useful tip is to ensure that any external links match the original language being used in the app! For example, “Terms & Conditions” written in French are not very useful if the user was originally using the app in Polish.
