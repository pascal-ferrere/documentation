# Tab

Tabs help users navigate between different content within a section or page. The content or data tabs contain is grouped in themes and are aligned to similar information on the same page.

---

Tabs are always used at the top of a section in order to indicate to the user that they filter content directly below it. Active tabs are always highlighted and you will never see less than two of them on screen.

## Usage

Tabs are navigational elements that allow users to filter different sets of content within a section or page. You should use tabs when there is too much information to display on a single page, especially if all the content or data can be organized into groups or sets. In general, content can be made up of text or images, or both. It can also be made up of other components such as containers, input fields, buttons, carousels, etc.

*Please note: *It is very important to aim to use only one word per tab text label. This is not only because pixel space is limited, but also because users may be confused if they see more than one word on a tab (the “one word approach” creates user patterns).

*Tabs are used for:*

- Filtering content into a minimum of two groups or sets

- Reducing the amount of content displayed on one page

- Used to hide content that is not relevant to the user while allowing them to stay on the same page

## States

Tabs are simple elements and available in three states:

- Active

- Inactive

- Disabled (Appears inactive but is not selectable)

## Variants

Tabs are available in two variants:

- White background

- Grey background

These variants can be created as:

- Text only

- Tag + Text

- Tags only

Tabs are always placed at the top of screens above the container that the related content resides in. Tabs are normally placed below any headers or navigation elements.

## Behavior

Tab’s behavior instantly toggles between states — the process allows users to know what content is being filtered and displayed below. Regardless of how many tabs there are, only one active state can be displayed at a time.

When a row of tabs is too wide for the screen we use horizontal scrolling in a carousel style to allow for more tabs to be added. We never create another row of tabs by wrapping.

*Please note: *Tabs support the use of tooltips.

## Dos & Don’ts

*Do:* Use tabs to allow the user to toggle between sets of content while staying on the same page — tabs exist in either active or inactive states. You must always use more than one tab in a set and only one tab can be active per screen.

*Don’t:* Never create multiple sets or rows of tabs in different sets of containers. Tabs are used at the top of the screen in one single row.

*Do: *If you have more tabs than can fit on a screen, use horizontal scrolling to indicate to the user that there are more available.

*Don’t: *Never use one single tab. Even two is questionable. Three is okay. Four or more is great.

## Microcopy

### *General*

Tab label text must be as concise as possible, ideally using only one word. Their terminology and nomenclature must remain consistent throughout the product. Using different terminology for similar tabs could lead to user frustration. Treat tabs in the same way you treat navigation terminology — keep it simple and consistent.

### *Wordcount*

You should aim to only use one word per tab. There may be occasions where two words are used, however, the preferred amount is to use only one word per tab. Always opt for one word only. For further brevity and clarity, never allow tab text to wrap or truncate.

### *Casing*

Tabs should normally be written in title case. Uppercase could be used for acronyms but this is a rare use case.

### *Punctuation*

In general, punctuation should be avoided. The exception is if a word is hyphenated. Terminal punctuation is not needed for tabs because it creates visual disruption.

### *Localization*

Translate your tab text label to see if it adequately fits into the container layout. English has one of the shortest character counts and often increases in length when translated into the main languages that Betclic products use — which is French, Polish, and Portuguese.
